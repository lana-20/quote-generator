# quote-generator

[Live Demo](https://lana-20.github.io/quote-generator/)

I am creating a random quote generator. I am making an asynchronous fetch request to a [Rest API](https://type.fit/api/quotes) in order to get my [quotes](https://quotes-react.netlify.app/).
I tried to make it as modern as possible. The first of the elements is adding a [hero patterns](http://www.heropatterns.com/) vector background, which allows for a unique look.
There are Font Awesome icons. I am also using a custom Google font. 
Down at the bottom, I have two buttons. The first is a New Quote button. 
There is a loader that loads between quotes. The idea is that when this takes a long time to load, which is does sometimes, I want to signal to
the user that somehing is happening behind the scenes even if they can't see it.
The other button is a Twitter button. When you click on it, it will open Twitter in a new tab and , if you are logged in, allow you to tweet using the Tweet button.
This project is mobile responsive. The quote container is fitting the size of most large smartphones and has a bit of margin on both sides.
